# CodeBot

Created for and during the Facebook Singapore Hackathon 2016.

CodeBot is a chatbot that helps beginners learn how to code. To make the otherwise daunting task of learning how to code for the first time easier, CodeBot incorporates witty replies, GIFs &amp; human-readable errors to create an incredibly fun experience for a complete novice. Currently, it goes through a few basic exercises in Python (adapted from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)).
